# TOMOHIRO UpWork project

It was small project with client from Japan. Tomohiro was his name.
He provide me index.html file with bootstrap div structure, but he didn't like what bootstrap do with it, so he gave me task to write small .css file for index.html provided without any div structure change.

Job was finished within one day and we finished our contract with opposite satisfaction.
